Browser-based RPG with turn-based combat system, in game economy, single and multiplayer modes, and room to grow. Developed in Scala on the Lift web framework

## Goals ##

### Combat ###
Combat will be a turn-based, position-oriented system. Characters will fight on positions in a grid, with ranged, melee, or magic skills. Skills will come in a wide variety so that everyone can find their own playstyles.

### Groups ###
A player will join a group of four characters. They may be NPCs or other players via the net. In combat, the player can control the actions his or her own NPCs, but not the gear they wear or the skills they bring.

### Exploration ###
The world will be large and explorable. Players may encounter towns, cities, wilderness, and dungeons as they go. As they explore the wilderness, enemies may approach. As they delve into dungeons, they must fight their way to the prize at the end. Towns and cities will serve as home to helpful services like inns and shops.

### Economy ###
Players will all have access to the in-game economy, where they can trade goods and money. A "want list" will be available for players to post trade options, make offers, or even make counter offers. The system won't require both parties to be present for the trade to go through: if an offer is accepted, the trade goes through immediately; if a counter-offer is made, the other party is able to accept or revise the offer at any time.

### Achievements ###
In game achievements will be awarded for certain accomplishments, and be able to be displayed for all to see. Records for things like the "infinite dungeon" will be posted as well.

### PvP ###
Players will have the option to form parties and battle each other for glory and bragging rights.
